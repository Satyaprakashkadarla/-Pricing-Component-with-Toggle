1. HTML Structure:

2. CSS Styles:

Toggle Switch Styling: Styling for the toggle switch using CSS.
Pricing Options Styling: Styling for the pricing options.

3. JavaScript:

Event Listener: Listen for changes in the toggle switch state.
Toggle Functionality: Update pricing options based on the toggle state (monthly or yearly).

HTML File (index.html):
Structure the HTML elements for the pricing component.
Include links to external CSS and JavaScript files.

CSS File (styles.css):
Add styles for the HTML elements to create the desired layout and appearance.
Include styles for the toggle switch and pricing options.

JavaScript File (script.js):
